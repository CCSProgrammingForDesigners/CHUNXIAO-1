  <h1>My favourite food</h1>
  <p>
  My favourite food is <strong style="color:red;">mushrooms</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
   I like them because I think they are very delicious and nutritious. There are many kinds of mushrooms in the world. Some
   are like small houses with big round heads and thick bodies. And some have the shapes of umbrellas.
  </p>
  <p>
    Mushrooms usually grow among trees in forests. My mother can cook mushrooms in many different ways. Mushrooms are very good
    for peopleâ€™s health.

  <p>
    I like mushrooms very much. They are healthy.
